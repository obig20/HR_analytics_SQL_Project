# HR_analytics_SQL_Project
Project Objective: Analyzed 1,400+ employee records to identify why talent is leaving and which employees are currently at risk.

Key Technical Milestones:

Data Cleaning: Resolved encoding issues, handled NULL values, and standardized schema column names.

EDA: Calculated attrition rates across Job Roles, Education levels, and Environment Satisfaction scores.

Advanced SQL: Utilized CTEs, Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, OVER), and Temporary Tables for complex data transformations.

Predictive Segmenting: Developed a "Flight Risk" model using multi-factor CASE logic (Overtime + Low Satisfaction + 0 Stock Options).

Top Insight: Employees matching the "High Risk" criteria show a significantly higher attrition rate compared to the company average, suggesting that work-life balance (Overtime) is a stronger lever than pay alone.
